# DEFO smart contracts
DEFO is a DeFi protocol on AVAX. If you buy a Yield Gem NFT with our DEFO token, you get DEFO rewards every week.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

Be sure you create .env file (see .env-example)
